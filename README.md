# time-series-analysis

This purpose of this assignment is to predict the future price of the Japanese Yen relative to the Canadian dollar.

The first approach makes predictions solely on a time series analysis. The first approach can be found in the Starter_Code directory,in the file named time_series_analysis.ipynb. After the prediction model was created, conclusions that can be drawn as follows:

* there is an expected appreciation of the Japanese Yen relative to the Canadian dollar
* it would be wise to purchase Japanese Yen now given the expected apprecition to occur

The second approach makes predictions with linear regression. This approach can be found in the Starter_Code directory, in the file regression_analysis.ipynb. With linear regression, refines the first approach to make more accurate decisions. Conclusions from the linear regression model are as follows:

* the return on investment of the Japanese Yen will be positive (supports the time series approach)
* the predicted return expects a future negative return of the investment in Japanese Yen
* out-of-sample data performs better than in-sample data
